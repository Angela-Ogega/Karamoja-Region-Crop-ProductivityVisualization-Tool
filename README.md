# Karamoja-Region-Crop-Productivity-Visualization-Tool
This repository contains a tableau visualization tool used to monitor food security and crop productivity in Karamoja region in Uganda.
# Project Description
Karamoja area in Uganda, just like many regions in Africa has been facing food security issues for a long time. This can be attributed to; prolonged dry spells, pests and diseases that compromise food quality and quantity in the region, poor planning, climate change, unemployment, poverty etc.

Over time, several NGOs have volunteered to provide technical support by availing farm inputs to the farmers in Karamoja region. The NGOs are however faced with a myriad of challenges with the main one being the overall visibility of the region. Most of the times, they are forced to rely on local sources for information on the food situation in the region which may be biased and inaccurate.

This project seeks to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision-making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja. This will be done through coming up with a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images.
The data available for this project was derived from the 2017 crop season. The data is inclusive of shape files that contain data on Boundaries of Uganda sub counties and Districts, tables with information on Crop yield, Population, Crop area, Crop Productivity etc

# Technology used
Tableau Desktop
# Usage
This visualization tool will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that will be developed for the NGO. The visualization tool developed can be adopted for similar projects.
