# Karamoja-Region-Crop-Productivity-Visualization-Tool
This repository contains a tableau visualization tool used to monitor food security and crop productivity in Karamoja region in Uganda.
# Project Description
Karamoja area in Uganda has been facing food security issues for a long time. The main reasons attributed to the food security situation in the region include; prolonged dry spell seasons, pests and diseases that compromise food quality and quantity in the region, poor planning, climate change etc.
Over time, several NGOs have come in and offered to provide technical support and provide farm inputs to the farmers in Karamoja region. The NGOs are however faced with the challenge of overall visibility of the region and often rely on local sources to paint a picture of the food situation in the region which may at times be lacking in matters accuracy.

Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision-making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja. To do so, Dalberg Data Insights developed a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images
The data available for this project was derived from the 2017 crop season. 
The data is inclusive of shape files that contain data on Boundaries of Uganda subcounties and Districts, tables with information on Crop yield, Population, Crop area, Crop Productivity etc.
# Technology used
Tableau 
# Usage
This visualization tool will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that DDI will develop for the NGO. This tool can be adopted for similar projects.
